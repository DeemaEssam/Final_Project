لقد ذكرنا في مقالة سابقة بعنوان ""وثمود الذين جابوا الصخر بالواد"" أن الوصف القرآني لمساكن قوم ثمود أو ما سمي بمدائن صالح جاء مطابقا لما أظهرته الصور المأخوذة من الجوجل إيرث لهذه المساكن. فمدائن صالح كما وصفها القرآن الكريم تقع في واد واسع يمتد من الشمال إلى الجنوب و يبلغ أقصى عرض له ما يقرب من خمسة عشر كيلومتر ثم يضيق وهو يتجه إلى الجنوب إلى أن يصل إلى أقل من كيلومتر عن مدينة العلا التي تقع إلى الجنوب من المدائن على بعد عشرين كيلومتر. ويحيط بهذا الواد سلاسل جبلية شاهقة فالسلسلة الغربية الشمالية من الواد يصل إرتفاعها إلى ألف وخمسمائة متر عن سطح البحر بينما يصل ارتفاع السلسلة الجنوبية الشرقية إلى ألف متر أما ارتفاع أرض الواد المنبسطة فيبلغ ثمانمائة متر عن سطح البحر. وفي هذه المقالة سنقوم بالاستعانة بصور الجوجل إيرث والمواصفات المذكورة في تفاسير القرآن الكريم للصخرة التي خرجت منها الناقة بتحديد مكان هذه الصخرة.
فقد جاء في تفاس��ر القرآن الكريم من أن الناقة التي أرسلها الله سبحانه وتعالى كآية إلى قوم ثمود قد خرجت من صخرة عظيمة تقع منفلردة في ناحية الحجر. وقد ذكر المفسرون أن ثمود اجتمعوا يوماً في ناديهم فجاءهم رسول الله صالح فدعاهم إلى الله وذكرهم وحذرهم ووعظهم وأمرهم فقالوا له: إن أنت أخرجت لنا من هذه الصخرة - وأشاروا إلى صخرة هناك - ناقة من صفتها كيت وكيت وذكروا أوصافاً سموها ونعتوها وتعنتوا فيها، وأن تكون عشراء، طويلة من صفتها كذا وكذا فقال لهم النبي صالح عليه السلام: أرأيتم إن أجبتكم إلى ما سألتم على الوجه الذي طلبتم أتؤمنون بما جئتكم به وتصدقوني فيما أرسلت به؟ قالوا: نعم. فأخذ عهودهم ومواثيقهم على ذلك. ثم قام إلى مصلاه فصلى لله عز وجل ما قدر له ثم دعا ربه عز وجل أن يجيبهم إلى ما طلبوا فأمر الله عز وجل تلك الصخرة أن تنفطر عن ناقة عظيمة عشراء على الوجه المطلوب الذي طلبوا أو على الصفة التي نعتوا فلما عاينوها كذلك رأوا أمراً عظيماً ومنظراً هائلاً وقدرة باهرة ودليلاً قاطعاً وبرهاناً ساطعاً فآمن كثير منهم واستمر أكثرهم على كفرهم وضلالهم وعنادهم. 
وقد يسأل سائل عن المصدر الذي استقى منه المفسرون هذه الروايات عن مواصفات الصخرة وكذلك الناقة والطريقة التي عقرت بها وحتى أسماء الأشخاص الذين تآمروا على قتلها. والجواب على ذلك أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قد قص على أصحابه كثيرا من تفصيلات قصة صالح عليه السلام مع قومه عند مروره بالحجر في طريقه إلى تبوك وقد حفظها من حفظها ونسيها من نسيها. فقد روى أبو الزبير عن جابر قال : لما نزلنا الحجر فغزا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تبوك ، قال : « أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ لاَ تَسْأَلُوا عَن هَذِهِ الآياتِ [ هؤلاء ] قَوْمُ صَالِحٍ سَأَلُوا نَبِيَّهُم أَن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ لَهُم آيَةً ، فَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ لَهُم نَاقَةً فَكَانَتْ تَرِدُ مِن ذَلَكِ الفَجَ فَتَشْرَبُ مَاءَهُم يَوْمَ وُرُودِهَا وَيَحْلِبُونَ مِنْهَا مِثْلَ الَّذِي كَانُوا يَشْرَبُونَ مِنْهَا يَوْمَ غِبِّهَا وَيَصْدِرُونَ عَن ذَلِكَ ، وَهُوَ مَعْنَى قَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى : { وَنَبِئّهُمْ أَنَّ الْمَآءَ قِسْمَةٌ بَيْنَهُم} » الآية.
وروى البخاري عن ابن عمر أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم لما نزل الحجر في غزوة تبوك أمرهم ألا يشربوا من بئرها ولا يستقوا منها فقالوا: قد عجنا واستقينا فأمرهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يهريقوا ما استقوا ويعلفوا الإبل العجين، وأمرهم أن يستقوا من البئر التي تردها الناقة. 
ويتبين لنا من هذه الأحاديث أنه إذا كان رسولنا الكريم صلى الله عليه وسلم قد حدد الفج الذي كانت تدخل منه الناقة والبئر التي كانت تشرب منه فلا يستعبد أن يكون قد حدد الصخرة التي خرجت منها وكذلك بقية التفاصيل المتعلقة بها وقام الصحابة بتداولها كروايات دون نسبتها إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم. 
أما مواصفات الصخرة فسنستخلصها من كتب التفسير ثم نقوم بمقارنتها بمواصفات الصخور الموجودة في الوادي اعتمادا على صور الجوجل إيرث. فقد جاء في تفسير ابن كثير ما نصه ""وفي الصحيح عن ابن عمر أن الناس نزلوا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم على الحجر أرض ثمود، فاستقوا وكانوا هم الذين سألوا صالحاً أن يأتيهم بآية واقترحوا عليه بأن تخرج لهم من صخرة صماء عينوها بأنفسهم وهي صخرة منفردة في ناحية الحجر يقال لها الكاتبة فطلبوا منه أن تخرج لهم منها ناقة عشراء تمخض فأخذ عليهم صالح العهود والمواثيق لئن أجابهم الله إلى سؤالهم وأجابهم إلى طلبتهم ليؤمنن به وليتبعنه فلما أعطوه على ذلك عهودهم ومواثيقهم قام صالح عليه السلام إلى صلاته ودعا الله عز وجل فتحركت تلك الصخرة ثم انصدعت عن ناقة جوفاء وبراء يتحرك جنينها بين جنبيها كما سألوا"". وإذا ما دققنا النظر في صورة الجوجل إيرث التالية نلاحظ وجود صخرة عظيمة مغطاة بالسواد تقع منفردة في أعلى يمين الواد. 
وهذه الصخرة من الضخامة بحيث أنها أقرب لئن تكون جبلا صخريا وهي ذات شكل عجيب مما يؤكد على الرواية التي تقول أن ثمود كانت تعبد آصنامها عندها. ويبلغ أقصى طول للصخرة ألف وخمسمائة متر أما أقصى عرض لها فيبلغ 700 متر ويبلغ أقصى ارتفاع لها مائة متر عن الأرض المحيطة بها. وسنسوق الآن الأدلة التي تثبت أن هذه الصخرة هي التي أخرج الله منها الناقة التي أرسلها آية كدليل على صدق سيدنا صالح عليه السلام. ",133,ar,7811061,,AlUla,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/73/20/eb/this-spectacular-rock.jpg,"This spectacular rock formation resembles an elephant with its trunk touching the ground, is one of AlUla's geomorphological wonders became one of AlUla iconic landmarks.",positive,Nature & Parks

They have decided that either you pay for a guided bus tour which gives you extremely limited time to see the sights, or you pay too much money to be shepherded around in a ""vintage Land Rover"" (as if anyone cares about what kind of car drives you to a heritage site) for the same amount of time, but without the other people. 
The experience of Dadan, in all honesty, was a joke. You cannot get close enough to see the only thing of interest at this site. So if you didn't bring your own binoculars, you can share the four provided on site with everyone else. The road is just behind you, you have exactly the same experience from the road. Then, after spending a full three minutes being told about the lions, you are hurried over to play in a sandbox. Twenty minutes. Grown adults who have travelled across the world to see the history of this place were given more time to pretend to dig up pottery than to learn about the site. 
Then you're driven three feet over to see the archaeological site where you're shown photos of the same archaeological site. 

Jabal Ikmah was better, the engravings and the site itself are astonishing. It was a real pleasure to discover this place and the thousands of years of history it represents. However, once again, be ready to be herded off again way too soon. 
After this visit you're given chisels and a rock and can carve some shapes if you're interested.

If the place is limited by age, why does someone enter and someone doesn't?
Even if the place is crowded, I wish they would divide the younger children from the older ones

If I have a 10-year-old child and you refuse to let him join the games, where should I take him?

We lack places for games, so if there is a nice place like this, I wish there was no age requirement, even though the boy is young at times, I don’t think that 10 years is too old to play games.

The written instructions do not support the employee’s words.

Entrance is 15, the pool is 20, and anything you need inside is for money, and the chalets are 125
This amount is nice if the place is worth it
The place is neglected in an indescribable way
The workers who run the kiosks and food shops lack all the cleaning tools, by God, you don't want to take a bottle of alcohol from them
The place opened more than 15 years ago and the furniture and games are still the same all these years
By God, we came back, if you saw our children's bodies after the pool, you wouldn't believe it, some had allergies and some had back abrasions from the very old slides
We left the pool and went to the electronic games, all of them were broken
Okay, we need the cars and buggies, their charge is finished and some of them are damaged
To be honest, the size of the pool and games is excellent and the supervisors, may God strengthen them, are working all the time, really up to the task

Advice for its owners
The place is beautiful and the distribution of the chalets around the pool is ideal The way the bathrooms are distributed is also unique

This attractive place needs renovation, restoration, and maintenance of the bathrooms’ sewage system, replacing the slides, and renovating the place

Why did you cancel the playground? It was a masterpiece. Make it smaller and make room for the cars, theater, and electronic games. Re-operate it and use it properly. Unfortunately, everything in it is old

Attract food trucks like the rest of the resorts. Don’t forget the kiosks. We didn’t find anything to eat in them. You have to order from outside. I remember that I wanted potatoes and things like that. They were all canceled

Welcome...
Welcome to the officials...

Sorry for the evaluation, I would have liked 5 stars.

Honestly, I don't know what the secretariat lacks in terms of experience, engineers and knowledge about the existence of many patches of grass that are not suitable for sitting. I mean, there is a parks administration. What have they provided for this place in terms of treatment and follow-up? There is a high amount of visual distortion in the park from dry grass, dilapidated sidewalks, holes and neglected trees.

The bathrooms, may God bless you, are almost non-existent and dirty and need complete maintenance.

Young people mingle with families.

The games need maintenance, washing and cleaning.

Why can't the park be a model? Where is the supervisor and where is the official?!!

What do you lack in terms of ideas, creativity and activation of the parks?

If you had held the facility for a living, you would have ruined it with violations.

The most failed idea for parks is entry fees.

While exploiting activities such as horse racing, swimming pools, amusement parks, grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, etc. ...
All for a symbolic rent and the proceeds go to developing the facility.

In short, every garden or park is a project that an office, employee, or company is responsible for. After structuring and designing it with a creative, exemplary design.

And every park competes with the other and surpasses it with better services than the other.

I hope for a kind gesture to these facilities, as they are a breathing space for middle-income and modest families.. I came to have fun and ended up with an inappropriate place and dozens of cats.

I have a lot up my sleeve, but this is what I wanted to offer for the renaissance in my country's breathing spaces 🇸🇦.

The mosque is located in the heart of the ancient city of Dumat al-Jandal, while the Islamic caliph Omar Bin Al-Khattab passes by Dahumat al-Jandal, who has returned from Jerusalem. Apparently they ordered it to be built in. The mosque's grounds are almost rectangular and extend from west to east. It is 32.5 meters long and 18 meters wide. There are two places to worship, one with winter walls and doors, and the main location is two rows of stone pillars that support the roof. There is a courtyard between the two. It was built between 634 and 644 and is famous for its attractive stone minaret, approximately 12.7 meters tall.

The house is privately owned and lived in by Dr Sami Angawi and his family.
Dr Angawi was born in Mecca and is an authority on Saudi Arabian architecture. The house is called Al Makkiyah and was 10 years in the making.
Dr Angawi built his house according to the wind. Capturing the wind from the north to the west, the house uses natural ventilation for half  of the year, throughout  different levels, limiting the need for air conditioning 
The house is constructed from many locally sourced materials. Dr Angawi’s wife Amira is an interior designer and whenever you see interior photographs of the house, you can see just how talented she is.
I discovered that the house is only available for visits and viewing at particular times and for group tours.
There was no such opportunity when I was in Jeddah, other than admiring the exterior of the house.
The research I did allowed me to discover that when there are opportunities for visits to the house the tickets cost around 200 riyals, which I believe includes tea being served to you.
It is difficult to find information on how you obtain tickets to see the house, if indeed this is still possible.

The bottom floor has a trampoline area and a swing area that works as an obstacle coarse. The upstairs area has a coffee bar, a selection of kids toys that can be used sitting at the table as well as a sandbox and ball pit.

Unfortunately, the lady at the front desk is rude and apathetic. She barely looked up from her phone long enough to speak to me. Worst than that… the place is a safety hazard!

I found a large screw fallen on the floor in the play area! It had obviously fallen into the play area where one of the walls was falling, leaving a giant opening leading to the cement floor under the trampoline. When I showed the employe that my child could fall through and hit the floor, she did nothing and continued sitting on her phone.

The steps leading up to the play area are NOT secured. It detached and rolled when I stepped on it, hitting my leg and causing me to trip, almost falling and dropping my child. It also left me with a bleeding leg and a giant bruise. When I spoke to the lady, her paraphrased response was “what do you want me to do I’m just an employee”. I told her to call her manager and request a worker come to secure the step and fix the fallen wall. She only went to fix the fallen wall after I mentioned liability and reporting the place to the correct authority.

It’s unfortunate because the place could have been a nice place. I wouldn’t come again unless the customer service improves and the safety concerns are addressed. I also wouldn’t drive more than ten minutes to reach here. It is ok if you live nearby and your kids are bored of their regular spots, but again, not with the current customer service and safety hazards.

Severe chaos and children screaming endlessly. There is no way to contain the children or calm them down.

secondly . Children who are 2 and a half years old go up stairs every day, and the stairs do not have any means of protection for them. It's unbelievable that they don't put classes on the ground floor.

Third. The classrooms are not equipped to teach children, as they lack any educational and sensory means.

All the educational, cognitive, color, and other aspects are located in a large room below, and all the school participates in them.

Meaning that children of each age group have an hour in this room that collects all the activities, and for the rest of the day, what do they do?...

Fourth.  The sand room is not spacious and narrow, meaning it cannot accommodate 15 children per class.

Fifth. Changing diapers, may God bless you, for children on the same changing table without a changing mat under each child and a diaper, no gloves or other clothes. Look at the amount of germs that will be transferred from one child to another.

VI. Most importantly, there is no bedroom for the children. The children sleep in the same classroom where the child’s owners sit, eat and play...reasonable.

And to those who asked them: How do you tell the employee to go to the quietest class and put the sleeping child? It is not logical to move the child to a class every day to sleep...

It took a while to schedule this family visit and then it took a while to get there, due to the traffic and when we did, we were surprised to find a number of the rides were not working: the carousel, the ice skating rink and the terminator to name but a few. My son is 128cm, so could not go on most of the rides, which start at 130cm. He was able to ride on the baby bumper cars, the water bumper cars and the big slide, which are designed for younger children. He is 9, but short for his age, but overall, he found those rides ok. He had been looking forward to ice skating, so was sad to find that the rink had turned into a seating area. Many of the indoor games were also not working. My son did get a chance to climb the climbing wall, which was good. What we found most frustrating, was that the rides (and not the food stalls) closed during prayer and we had nothing to do for 30 minutes.  The park looks like it has not been renovated for over 10 years, with red/white tape placed on games, and doors that are no longer working. It really needs a revamp.

The well is said to have been dug by the companions of the Prophet Muhammad and is believed to have provided them with water during their stay in Medina. According to Islamic tradition, it was at this well that the Prophet Muhammad and his followers took refuge during their migration from Mecca to Medina.

Aside from its historical significance, Ghar'a Well is also significant due to its architectural style and design. The well is made up of a series of interconnected underground chambers, which were designed to store water and protect it from the elements. The walls of the chambers are made of dressed stone and the well has a distinctive, domed roof that is made of brick.

Visitors to Ghar'a Well can still see the remains of the well and its surrounding structures, which have been partially restored in recent years. The site is open to visitors and is a popular destination for tourists and religious pilgrims alike.

In conclusion, Ghar'a Well is a unique and important historical site in Medina, Saudi Arabia, that has great significance for both its historical and architectural value.

That day, I went to the grounds where there was a Frozen and Snowman party, but there was nothing there at all, just free play and half the corners were floating!
When I asked them, they said because those present were young, under 5 years old!

1-The place does not support the Mobily or Zain network...no internet or connection...it is cut off from the world.

2-The pool water is not very clean, despite the worker’s words: “The filters are working.”

3- The external sprinklers are broken... and there is no external desert air conditioner (if you have an outdoor session with the weather, don’t think about it).

4-The external lighting is so weak that not all children can be seen in the water toys.

5- This may be a personal preference, but the two sections are separate and there is no door between them...you have to go out to it from outside the chalet, and this causes me to worry all the time about the children because there are a large number of dogs in the area.

6-All swimming pools in the rest house are 1 meter high.

7-In one of the separate sections there is one bathroom.

8- Mistreatment and unresponsiveness of the rest house worker and its owner.

During our recent visit to Madinah, we had the privilege of visiting the house of Syeda Fatimah bint Husayn, a place deeply entrenched in history. She built this house and a well inside it when she moved from her grandmother Fatima's (RA) house. This move was necessitated when Fatima's house became part of the expanding Prophet's Mosque. Syeda Fatimah remained in Madinah while her father participated in the battle of Karbala, where he ultimately met his martyrdom in 110 AH. Fatima was also present in Karbala and was later taken as a captive to Kufa and then to Damascus, along with other members of Imam Hussain's family. Despite the hardships she endured, Fatima played a crucial role as a narrator of the tragic events of Karbala and its aftermath. It is said that Syeda Fatimah's resemblance to her grandmother, Fatima (RA), the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), was striking, adding a poignant layer to her story.

It’s a steep mountain. Anyone with back problems of any kind or mobility concerns should not attempt this mountain. It takes 2 hours for an able bodied person to climb and up to 4 hours for anyone else. Rocks are steep and the journey is treacherous winding up the mountain. You are constantly near to cliff edges there are no barriers to stop you falling so you must have good treads on your shoes to grip. You go up and down the same way. Many people will be using the same route as you. There are small hut shops dotted along the route so you can buy water and snacks if yours run out. I highly recommend a sugar fix maybe juice or chocolate to normalise your blood pressure for when you reach the top. There is a snack hut at the top. And no there are no toilets along any of the route. When you reach the top access to the small cave is tiny. Only a few people can fit. There will be a small queue for those wanting to offer prayers inside the cave. Coming down is harder than upwards because gravity will make you go faster. Many people fall and slip on the gravel on the way down. Take it slow. Don’t try and be fast, or smart. You cannot outwit nature. I saw people with diabetes, high blood pressure, old age, mobility issues, cry tears of pain and exhaustion having come so far and have to turn back because the physical pain was just too much to bear. If you have to walk a lot the next day then this uphill climb is not for you. It will leave you exhausted, tired, and ladies will get swollen ankles and feet. Go with a positive mindset. Take it very slow. Good grip shoes or trainers. Take snacks and liquids. Set aside at least 3 to 4 hours uphill. And 2 hours downhill. When you get to the top it is worth seeing and feeling what the Beloved had to go through. A spiritual place indeed. Don’t worship it. Be considerate of it and mindful of the mercy and miracle the Almighty bestowed on his Beloved.",1,en,23815655,,Makkah,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/73/f4/7a/caption.jpg,,positive,Nature & Parks

I’m a fairly experienced kayaker in seas, lakes, rivers and rapids and this is the first time I have been discriminated against because of my size. (I would say I’m small-mid fat, US size 16-18) The member of staff told me and my whole group that I should use a double kayak “because of my weight” but didn’t back this up with an explanation. Maybe the kayaks here are cheaper and less sea worthy than others I’ve used previously. I did it anyway to save embarrassment and time because the process of getting us on the water was very slow. As it happened, the girl who shared with me was much smaller and the weight distribution was completely wrong due to this being a double kayak. I felt unsafe the whole time but luckily, as mentioned I am experienced and a very strong swimmer.  Then we had a great time all kayaking together and swimming together, but at the end another member of staff suggested we set up a photo for breast cancer awareness and told us to “form the shape of a ribbon with our kayaks”.

Meanwhile, he is extremely serious about taking pictures for guests. His standards for photos are even higher than my own! I highly  appreciate him and  will recommend him to all my friends who want to travel to Arabia. Thanks！

我会给他超过5星的评价。我去过很多地方，也请过很多向导，大部分人只是把这个当成一份工作，但是我觉得Abdullah是真的热爱这个地方。他甚至在山顶上有一个“办公室”！当他介绍这里的时候，他如此的滔滔不绝，就像他是这个地方的主人一样。而且他对拍照的要求甚至比我自己更高，他非常认真的对待他的客人和他的工作，所以我非常的欣赏他，我会把他推荐给我所有我想来利雅得旅游的朋友，谢谢",27,en,27716290,,Riyadh,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/35/18/26/caption.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1,"My name is Abdullah, and I am a certified professional tour guide.

I ordered a hot mocha, an iced vanilla drink, and an ice tea.
My family agreed that all of the drinks were very tasty and satisfying. We ordered a chocolate and blueberry muffin, and a slice of blueberry cheesecake, and 3 egg and cheese sandwiches. The muffins were warm so they tasted pretty good. The cheesecake was old and very stale BUT! In their defense they replaced it the next day with a slice that was much better. Being from the USA it was not the cheesecake taste that i was use to but someone said that cheesecake here is made differently and when you compare the two I guess that the extremely rich decadent version is not all that good for ya...whatever you need to tell yourself right?🤣
So as I was writing above, they redeemed themselves the next day with a fresh slice so all was well.
They offered me a free coffee as well but as I mentioned above, the mocha coffee was very tasty so there was no need.
Am I the only one that did not know that here in Riyadh an egg and cheese sandwich means ""a boiled egg"" and cheese sandwich? Anywho...
The brother who comes outside to wait on you is very kind, pleasant. And efficient!  Yes, I did write that he comes outside, takes your order and returns pretty promptly to your car with your food.
Even though I was served in my car I gave 5 🌟 because well the waiter created a very pleasant atmosphere 😊
I think that their business is going to grow once word gets around that you are served old style at the window of your car.. I worry though about the traffic, and parking space once business picks up. It is very limited and shared with other businesses 🤔
I should mention that they are a bit pricy. I spent 92SAR. Didn't really pay attention because I was paying with a card😕. When I returned the next day and realized that a coffee and muffin was 20SAR...let's just say that my new breakfast place won't see me as often as I thought.",308,en,ChIJ1SZUF9YELz4REOQ9BVOR6z4,,Riyadh,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbxVBba_8ge2eXZYb0N_ZpG4ljHbJ42wDEfIbb=w408-h415-k-no,,positive,cafe shops

Spout cafe is one to look out for. Brilliant taste, excellent service and great new ambience.

Service (9/10): Fast service, neat and tidy place. The baristas and hosts were cordial. COVID checks done at entry.

Ambience (9/10): I personally love dark themed cafes and restaurants so I am rating it highly however the internal decor is really fantastic.

Drinks (8/10): The taste was appealing and it is surely a place I would recommend for an unique experience. As it is located in the The Zone, the external setting too enhances the mood. The price is a bit on the higher side which was slightly unsettling.

Drinks Ordered :
1. Spout Latte (Cold) : A very unique blend of strong and sweet cold latte. A very special taste which I haven't had anywhere yet. It is strong as well as sweet which was really mind-blowing for me.
2. Spanish Latte (Cold): Their Spanish latte was also great in taste but nothing special in terms of uniqueness.

I had aligned with the owner (Mr. Mohammed), yesterday to take pictures and videos for my review.

The ambiance is beautiful, with a nice aesthetic design, comfortable seating,  white curtains, and indoor plants, adorning the Café.

There is  both indoor and outdoor seating, and the views are amazing, especially King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) buildings and some prominent hotels (Move n Pick) on the opposite side of the road.

The expert barista and roaster is Mr. Mohammed Fouad, from Yemen 🇾🇪 with over 3 years experience and Mr. Sujal from Nepal 🇳🇵 is the barista with over 2 years of experience. Let's discover the coffee.

The first is a Kalita drip coffee hot, brewed by hand with Colombia 🇨🇴 NARINO coffee beans with a cup flavor profile of fruity, sweetness, apple, full texture, the sweet taste and flavor was refreshing. My rating is 10 out of 10.

The second is an espresso double shot brewed with Ethiopia GUJI SHAKISO coffee beans with a cup flavor profile of fruity, sweetness, jasmine, green apple, rich texture. It is indulgent with balanced acidity and velvety creamy body. My rating is 10 out of 10.

The last is Flat White, prepared with Brazil ROSA MORENA coffee beans with a cup flavor profile of floral, moderate sweetness, smooth acidity, and a rich body. The expertise of barista was evident (standard hot temperature doing the trick). The taste was nice and balanced. My rating is 9 out of 10.

The three desserts paired with the coffees have been ideal in complimenting the flavors of the coffee.

The Cinnamon had a well-balanced sweetness and smooth texture of the brioche, the topping of caramel, and Dulce de Leche sauce with nuts had me craving for....every bite was pure delight with Kalita drip coffee. My rating is 10 out of 10.

The crunchy bite (chocolate and toasted coconut) had a nice taste and flavor perfect with the espresso double shot coffee. My rating is 9 out of 10.

The pecan tart had a mild flavor and taste. The tarts are meant to be rich with crunch of the pecans and firm texture of the tart shell ... this one was just not there... missing the finesse . My rating is 8 out of 10.

Overall rating is 9.5 out of 10.

@Mr. Mohammed (owner), Fouad (Expert Barista & Roaster), and Sujal (Barista), thanks for hosting me today.

An unforgettable and memorable experience of my food journey in search of the best cafés, bakeries, and restaurants.

Highly recommended in Riyadh. A definite MUST Visit! 👍😘👌

Blurred out lines

to coffee
Another vagabond
lost to love.

4am alone and on my way.
These are my finest moments.
I scrub my skin
to rid me from
you
and I still don’t know why I cried.
It was just something in the way you took my heart and rearranged my insides and I couldn’t recognise the emptiness you left me with when you were done. Maybe you thought my insides would fit better this way, look better this way, to you and us and all the rest.
But then you must have changed your mind
or made a wrong
because why did you
leave?

6 months, 2 weeks, 4 days,
and I still don’t know which month it was then
or what day it is now.
I replace cafés with crowded bars and empty roads with broken bottles
and this town is healing me slowly but still not slow or fast enough because there’s no right way to do this.
There is no right way to do this.

There is no right way to do this.

Just the other day, I was in my neighborhood Starbucks, waiting for the post office to open. I was enjoying a chocolatey cafe mocha when it occurred to me that to drink a mocha is to gulp down the entire history of the New World. From the Spanish exportation of Aztec cacao, and the Dutch invention of the chemical process for making cocoa, on down to the capitalist empire of Hershey, PA, and the lifestyle marketing of Seattle's Starbucks, the modern mocha is a bittersweet concoction of imperialism, genocide, invention, and consumerism served with whipped cream on top.

There are those who love to get dirty and fix things. They drink coffee at dawn, beer after work. And those who stay clean, just appreciate things. At breakfast they have milk and juice at night. There are those who do both, they drink tea.

I am so happy and excited to visit yet another new destination, I am at Sulalat,  a world of the finest specialty luxury coffees.

My colleagues at work, Nama and AJS, wanted me to do a review of Sulalat popular for premium coffees and baked treats. Let's go ... discover Sulalat.

The espresso single shot was the ultimate experience of a coffee connoisseur, heavy creamy body with oud and cacao notes prepared from Exit 13 (Sulalat blend), coffee beans from Indonesia (Java), Gautamela, and Ethiopia. My rating is a perfect 10 out of 10.

The coffee latte was  exquisite as the barista followed the recipe to the T (36 to 43 seconds to get it right!). The Exit 13 Sulalat blend is a delightful selection. My rating is 9 out of 10.

The Aeropress drip coffee uses Aljoud coffee beans from Saudi Arabia (locally grown in Southern Region -Jazan), and the method to prepare is unique and different. The last step required a  press to release all the goodness of a black coffee. My rating is 11 out of 10.

The baked treats and amazing assortment of croissants, the brownie croissant with vanilla, chocolate, and caramel filling was a flavor burst. Oh wow! Oh yum! What was that! My rating is 10 out of 10.

The plain croissant, a humble baked goodness, it is light soft, fluffy, crispy, and simply delicious paired with coffee latte ... hmmm. My rating is 9 out of 10.

Overall rating is a perfect 10 out of 10.

It's already Saturday, Good morning, Riyadh, ""Saturday is a gentle reminder to enjoy the little things in life.” Today, I am at Some Coffee Bar bright and early at 6 AM, I have the go-ahead to take pictures and videos for my review.

The ambiance is beautiful with lots of natural light, well designed, and great seating.

There is a variety of coffee beans on display and awesome selection of cheesecakes, pastries, and croissants. Let's discover Some Coffee Bar and evaluate the delightful treats!

The barista of the day is Mr. Javed Aziz, from Kashmir, India 🇮🇳 😀 😎 and today he is brewing a  couple of espresso shots, a couple of V60 drip coffees, and a Cortado.

The espresso single shot brewed with Ethiopia Sidamo coffee beans with a cup profile of walnut, peach, and choco, awesome crema, and fruity bittersweet flavor and taste, my rating is 10 out of 10.

The next surprise, is another espresso single shot, but this time it is brewed with China Honey King coffee beans with a cup profile of honey, raspberry, and grape, awesome crema, nice fruity sweet flavor and taste, my rating is 10 out of 10.

The Cortado is a single espresso shot made with Colombia Santa Rosa coffee beans with a cup profile of fruity pomegranate sweetness and an equal portion of latte. My first impression is that it had a bit more latte diluting the boldness of the espresso. My rating is 8 out of 10.

The V60 brewed by the machine with Ethiopia Sidamo coffee beans had a fruity bittersweet flavor profile, and my rating is 9 out of 10.

The next cup of drip coffee V60 hot, brewed by the machine with Rwanda Gesheke coffee beans, had nuts, peach, fruity cup.profie, bittersweet taste, and flavor.  My rating is 9 out of 10.

Now for the sweet treats, the Raspberry Danish pastry with nice crispy layered puff pastry with delicious pistachio custard and topped with fresh raspberries, an outright best seller. My rating is 11 out of 10.

The Belgian chocolate cookie was delicate, soft, and tasty, a bit too greasy for my palate and hands (too oily). My rating is 7 out of 10.

Overall rating is 9 out of 10.

@Mr. Javed Aziz and Mr. Md Motaleb Hosen, and the entire team at Some Coffee Bar. Thanks for hosting me today.

The baristas Rifat Hossain 🇧🇩 and Damodar Bhurtel 🇳🇵 are brewing a coffee latte made from their in-hose blend coffee beans (Ethiopia and Columbia). My rating is 7 out of 10.

I greet Saeed (a seasoned barista) and get permission to take pictures and videos for my review.

I am scanning the cafe and wondering how I can showcase the interiors. Wall painting, plants through pictures. Let's see ... the  ambiance is  simple, nice seating, and welcoming....

There are an impressive variety of coffee beans on display, and today, the Ethiopian, West Arsi, Erlium (the crop is grown at 2100 - 1945 altitude, the cupping notes are fruity, chocolate, black grape) this coffee variety is used to prepare a hot cup of V60 coffee (machine made), Saeed did the processing from start to finish 😋, well done! my rating is 9 out of 10.

My dessert for today is a brownie, crunchy chocolate, and rocky road. It was a delightful selection, and the sweet treats complimented well with the V60 coffee. My rating is 9 out of 10.

The menu is varied and the prices are very reasonable, ranging from 3 to 22 SAR💵.

Whether you want a classic coffee or something more indulgent, Moosh has it. I tried the flat white, and it was amazing perfectly balanced and creamy.

Additionally, Moosh offers a points system. They ask for your phone number at each visit to add points, which can be redeemed for rewards later on. It's a great way to get even more value out of your visits.

Overall, Moosh combines convenience, quality, and exceptional service.

As it says on one of the walls of this beautiful cafe. Thank you for inviting me and letting me try some of your stuff. The people there were friendly and very welcoming! Having great service definitely adds to the overall experience. And my experience here was great.

The cafe follows a clean and minimal aesthetic with super comfortable seats that are well spaced out with the serving area right in the middle of the cafe. We were given both the signature drinks, The Hot and Iced Central Latte, Cheese turkey sandwich, Chicken Teriyaki Sandwich, Iced Spanish Latte, Hot Chocolate, Two Coffee of the days which were essentially Black Coffees but one of them with milk, and a Blueberry Cheesecake. I really liked the Iced Central Latte, it’s good and it can cover a wide range of customers preferences, not the best for those who love a strong coffee taste in their drink, for that sort of preference I’d definitely recommend the Coffee of the day and the Hot Central Latte.

Good morning, Riyadh. My next destination is recommended by my colleague at wor, Mr. Dmitry Trubkin, I have seen this cafe and roastery many times on my way to work. Well, the day has come sooner than expected.

I am super excited to review Core Coffee & Roastery (by dr. Cafe Coffee) located inside Jarir Bookstore building on Thumamah road.

I met the two expert baristas, Mr. Qasim and Mr. Abdulrahman and I have the go-ahead to take pictures and videos for my review.

The espresso single shot is brewed from the signature blend (coffee beans from Central America), tasting notes tropical fruits, dark chocolate, and hazelnut. The flavor and taste were smooth, creamy, and medium-roast. My rating is a perfect 10 out of 10.

The flat white was also made from the signature blend with a single espresso shot, and the steamed latte had a nice refreshing taste. My rating is 9 out of 10.

The drip coffee V60 hot was brewed with Ethiopia Guji coffee beans with tasting notes of papaya, dried apricots, and apple. It's the best coffee, especially when paired with a premium assortment of fine chocolates. My rating is 10 out of 10.

The dessert of the day was the creamy classic cake, while the nixed berries and red currant toppings and the graham crackers base were nice and tasty the cheese/cake wasn't so smooth and moist (a tad dry for my palate). My rating is 8 out of 10.

The assorted fine chocolates (crepe dulcey, almond praline with rice crispy, mini chocolate monarch, pecan caramel chocolate, mini chocolate salted caramel) was so yummylicious! My rating is 10 out of 10.

Overall rating is 9 out of 10.

@Mr. Qasim and Mr. Abdulrahman, thanks for hosting me today.

A beautiful morning, as the city wakes up, I am on the road looking for my next destination.

Good morning, Riyadh, It is 6:35 AM, i am at Elixir Bunn, and after chatting with Mr. Zuhair, I have the go-ahead to take pictures and videos for the review.

Just a quick background story on the Café as per their official website:
""Our story began with the search for the best way to compose distinct flavors from Latin, African, and other sources of coffee across the world, with 10,000 taste buds in every sip. We believe that drinking coffee is one of the source of happiness and energy for millions of coffee tasters in Saudi Arabia. And for our interest in continuing and enhancing this experience from the pioneers of the coffee elixir, we sought to import the finest types of coffee in the world.""

Wow! The Café has beautiful interiors and very spacious and well arranged seating. There is another spacious  room with a nice center table that can seat 8 people. The Café has a cool chic ambiance. Once the record player is fixed, there are over a hundred records to choose your favorite songs.

Now, for some real action with Yazeed Alhumaidi, the expert barista with over 4 plus years of experience.

I get a freshly brewed hot cup of coffee. Elixir Bunn branded Kitropiki coffee beans from Uganda 🇺🇬 Yazeed is using Kalita equipment to make the drip coffee.

Coffee Equipment background:
""Kalita is a family-owned Japanese company, first established at Nihonbashi, Tokyo in 1958. The company has been making coffee equipment for a few decades now, turning into one of the most prolific companies in the coffee products business sector.""

Kitropiki is a single origin coffee from the Rwenzori Mountains, Kasese District, Western Uganda, grown at 1900 meters above sea level. Taste: berries, tea hint, tropical fruits.

My rating is 11 out of 10.

Yazeed recommends Tiramisu dessert to compliment this exquisite coffee. The Tiramisu is made in-house at Elixir Bunn and has a very nice texture and the right amount of sweetness, chocolate, and coffee. This is a seriously delicious rating, is 8 out of 10.

As per Mr. Edward Yung (customer), he rates Elixir Bunn with a solid 8 out of 10.

My overall rating is 9.5 out of 10.

@Zuhair and Yazeed, thanks for hosting me today.

Our Landover tour started at Hegira visiting Hinat bint Wahab reconstruction in purpose minor museum at the south gate welcome center. It is magnificent and intriguing to see the human reconstruction of Hinat, the first ever of a Nabatean resident. The entire reconstruction process is shared along with tomb # 117 where her skeleton was discovered. 
Thereafter, we visited the unfinished tomb of Lihyan son Kuza, often referred to as Madain Saleh. From there to Jebal AlAhmar (Red Mountain) where tomb # 117 is located. 
This was followed by Jebel Ithlib and the Diwan, which is superb, somewhat like a movie set with picturesque mountains that are incredible. Simply beautiful. 
Jebal Banat (Mountain of the Women) that is extraordinary, with permission to enter tomb # 26 to witness how the ancient Nabatean were buried. I was silent for much of the trip as one becomes speechless at the breathtaking views.

The next day was Jebal Khuraibah to see the tombs and excavations of Dadan & Lihyan civilizations that occured before the Nabatean. The lion tombs were resplendent and towering. Then we went across to Jebal Ikmah to view the petroglyphs that is the anciet rock art in the ancient Aramaic language that was before Arabic. It's referred to as the open air library. Our visit to AlUla Old Town was magnificent especially the view from the top of the castle. In summary, these sites are never enough viewing it only once, and therefore repeated visits are enriching and expansive to knowledge of how the Nabatean lived on the ancient Incense Road. It's no wonder that it is a recognized UNESCO World Heritage site.

The journey to the Edge of the World made us down in the dumps because it turned out to be a failed mission (“A Series of Unfortunate Events”). So as we were heading back to the capital city, we were discussing the discomforts of what took place in that valley and the plight’s silver lining. This was when the place called “Diriyah” surfaced. Thank heavens, all of us, especially Chauffer Sai, were still up for a rebound.

In my homeland, we usually head up to the high lands for a breath of fresh air but not here in Riyadh. Heading down to the low-lying areas like this Wadi Hanifah coulee is the theme.

Yes, we did not make it to the Edge of the World but setting foot on this historical site is also an experience of a lifetime. For a lover of history, it is always an opportunity to get a feel of an old place’s historical thread because it provides an understanding of how the place and its landscape have developed over time. How saddening it would be if we only get to learn by books more so if this were the only way to see them.

Wadi Hanifah is a great rebound and a hideaway for the city dwellers of Riyadh..",343,en,10358022,,Riyadh,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/e3/22/25/wadi-hanifah.jpg,,positive,Nature & Parks

The guides drove safely and were very accommodating — when we were unable to visit sites on the agenda due to closures, we worked together to come up with alternatives. We also stopped at random places on the road, like a camel milk market and a honey farm. Tourism in Saudi Arabia is in its infancy, so flexibility and an adventurous spirit are necessary. I was satisfied with my choice of 3-star hotels, which were pretty good for that part of the world and had decent breakfast buffets. I would encourage travelers to do their own research and visit places of interest that might not be on the set itineraries.

Al-Dwaihra Mosque,5,Religious Sites,"Al Imam Abdulaziz Ibn Mohammad Ibn Saud, Al Bujairi, Ad Diriyah, Diryah 13711 Saudi Arabia",24.73679,46.57528,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1889404-d23146323-Reviews-Al_Dwaihra_Mosque-Diryah_Riyadh_Province.html,5,"We visited from Japan on a local guided tour. The Al Dwaihra Mosque is located in the Al Bujairi district of Ad Diriyah, known as the ""Pearl of Saudi Arabia"". It is located about 20km northwest of the centre of Riad. A narrow river flows through the valley called Wadi Hanifah, and on the other side is the Al Turaif district, a world heritage site with Salwa Palace, the first capital of the Saud dynasty.
The riverbank is planted with many date palms and is green, making it a park where you can have a picnic. The nearby sun-dried mud brick building has been beautifully restored, and the ground is covered with stone tiles, making it completely dusty. The mosque is a narrow alley.

When we visited, it was quiet and it was a weekday and there was no one there. In Saudi Arabia, event periods are set for each tourist destination, and Diriyah Season is from November to December (last time 22 Nov 2019 - 21 Dec 2019), so you can see ruins and facilities that are not normally open to the public. This is the best time to visit this area as you can. We visited near the end of Al Ula's Winter at Tantora Season 2 (19 Dec 2019 - 7 Mar 2020), so it was not an event time in Diriyah, and the surrounding area was blocked due to the preparations for the classic car event. There are also.
There are no easy-to-understand signs in the park or at the entrance to the mosque, so if you don't understand Arabic, it would be difficult to visit Al Dwaihra Mosque without a guide. The staff member let me in and we toured the room through the glass.

Sunni religious scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was welcomed by Ibn Saud of Diliah in 1744 and spread his teachings. It is unknown when the Al Dwaihra Mosque was built, but it is quite old. The architectural styles of 10 historical mosques in Saudi Arabia are explained in the Najdi Style and the Abdullatif Al Fozan Award ""Historical Mosques in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Investigating Architectural Styles Typology."" Of the 10, we also visited Mimar Mosque, Umar Ibn Al Khattab Mosque and Shafe'i Mosques on this trip, and we were pleased to see some of the most representative mosques in a short period of time. Furthermore, the Abdullatif Al Fozan Award website includes Mosqpedia, which covers mosque architecture information, and if you search for ""Dwaihra"", you can see photos and drawings, making it a very valuable site for architecture lovers.

Also, while looking for photos before the mosque's restoration, information about Al Bujairi is known as ""Al-Bujairi...Heart of the Call"" in Publications on the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC) website. There is a 134-page publication covering the book, featuring photos of the mosque taken in the 1960s by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy, along with photos after the restoration. There are also photos that allow you to see the bricks and the ceiling after the restoration, and illustrations inspired by the time. The mosque name is listed as ""Al Dhuwayhirah mosque"". The RCRC website has a very comprehensive resource on Riyadh, and there are still few publications on Saudi Arabia, so it is very helpful. By the way, there are Arabic and English versions.

Until I saw the photos before the restoration of the mosque, I thought that the restoration of the Saudi Arabian ruins would be too clean and not seem to have been aged, but since the construction method is a simple method based on sun-dried mud bricks, the area has deteriorated. I was able to understand that once I fixed it and repaired it to a passable state, the only way to fix it in such a way is to fix it neatly. To prevent such misunderstandings, it is easy to understand if you post photos of the site before the repair is displayed.",1,ja,23146323,,Riyadh,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/b1/d6/31/al-dwaihra-mosque.jpg,,positive,Religious Sites

I recently visited this hotel and had a mixed experience. The atmosphere and ambience were pleasant and welcoming, and the service was good. However, the rates were quite high, which I felt was not entirely justified by the quality of food.

I ordered the chicken jalfrezi and shahi daal, both of which were unfortunately very average in taste. The dishes lacked a wow factor and were quite normal, which was disappointing considering the high prices.

Overall, while the hotel's atmosphere and service were good, the high rates and average food quality left me feeling slightly underwhelmed. Perhaps with a few improvements in the culinary department, this hotel could live up to its full potential.

*Pros:*

- Good atmosphere and ambience
- Friendly and efficient service
- Clean and comfortable surroundings

*Cons:*

- High rates
- Average food quality
- Limited value for money

*Recommendation:*

This hotel has potential, but needs to work on its food quality and pricing strategy to justify the high rates. If you're looking for a comfortable stay and don't mind average food, this might be a decent option.

The prices are exaggerated. In Riyadh, Sparky's, Safari Land, and others have games for 5 and 6, and there are many for 3 riyals.
Why do you have less or more games with 10 or 12 times the budget? I hope they open competitors for you 👍

The workers, as they are, stop the machine, and if you talk to them, they turn and turn, and there is no official to talk to, because they are among them.
The games are known to be 4 minutes long, and I usually spend time with them, so why not when I pay 12, but because the line is full, it is not my fault, they have the right to play the full time 😕

I like to practice my daily hobby, which is walking after the dawn prayer
The park is beautiful, but uncomfortable, not safe for children, and not clean.

The sidewalk is too small for walking.
Water sprinklers fill the sidewalk with water, and they may also get wet due to their proximity to the sidewalk while walking.
The chairs are poorly located and take up a lot of space on the sidewalk designated for walking.
The location of the castings is very, very, very bad.
The sidewalk has a landing.
The palm tree takes up part of the sidewalk.
The place is full of dead cockroaches and flies.

And now the most dangerous thing!!!
Power transformers in the park and water touching them may cause, God forbid, fatal injuries.
Especially children, they cannot read and do not understand how dangerous it is. They may play around it and it may cause injury to them.

If I come with children, I will not choose this park, which harms the beauty and splendor of the Tabuk region, especially since Tabuk is a tourist destination for everyone.

I hope they will re-maintain and control the park and make it safe and comfortable for everyone, because this is the first time I have seen a park this bad and dangerous at the same time.",220,en,ChIJh8fZD26yqRURUc1rv1Sd95E,,Tabuk,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlQC2Cd1bYgWQXT7gysmsGTSqsD5iZSvss7Iys=w408-h544-k-no,,positive,Nature & Parks

Our stay-🏚
We stayed in yanbu which is 2hours away drive from Umluj.
We booked @novotel_yanbu through booking.com for three nights.

Umluj Boat ride-🛥
We booked our ride from @umluj_serves. There are different rates  for different boats and yachts. You can choose your timings, we went from 9am to 1pm.
We were a group of 10 people and opted for this boat in frame and it costed us total sr1000 + sr130 (fruit basket) for 4 hours. 

Keep exploring for more boats as you can get cheaper ones too, we got to know about the cheaper ones after we had booked and did the advance payment. So keep contacting different boat guides. 

Activities-🚤
•If you're lucky then you can get to see dolphins, turtles and fish. Unfortunately we couldn't see dolphins or turtles.🐬🐢🐠
Tip- carry khubs or roti so that seagulls can come closer to you. 

• Our boat anchored  into the middle of the sea where there was shallow water and we stayed there for around 2 hours. It was definitely the best experience from the whole boat ride. Swimming, floating and relaxing and clicking pictures. All you could see was crystal clear water and beautiful shades of blue around till far. 
😍
• Fishing- none of us were interested in it so we didn't do fishing. 🐠

Definitely a mesmerising experience for sea lovers.❤❤❤",4,en,21287972,https://saudiarabiatours.net/umluj-tours/,Umluj,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/02/32/de/caption.jpg,"Explore Umluj !

Hanan Street Market is one of the most important commercial streets and tourist attractions in the city.

Close to it, you will encounter The Night Market, one of the oldest ancient markets. It is estimated to be 500 years old, since the construction of the port of Yanbu. It was the main destination for merchants and owners of commercial caravans to display their goods. The reason for its name is that trade in the past took place at night. However, various goods and products are sold now throughout the day.

Not far from it is Deira Market, which is distinguished for selling foodstuffs and all household items, in addition to kiosks and modern stores that sell other commodities. There are also play centers for kids.",positive,Historical Sites & Landmarks
